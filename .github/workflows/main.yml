# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the main branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # We'll run the tests on both Linux and OSX
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        platform: [ubuntu-latest] # , macos-latest] # Too slow :(

    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ${{matrix.platform}}

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
