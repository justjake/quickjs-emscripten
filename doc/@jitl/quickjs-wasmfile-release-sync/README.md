# @jitl/quickjs-wasmfile-release-sync

Variant with separate .WASM file. Supports browser ESM, NodeJS ESM, and NodeJS CommonJS.

This generated package is part of [quickjs-emscripten](https://github.com/justjake/quickjs-emscripten).
It contains a variant of the quickjs WASM library, and can be used with quickjs-emscripten-core.

```typescript
import variant from "@jitl/quickjs-wasmfile-release-sync"
import { newQuickJSWASMModuleFromVariant } from "quickjs-emscripten-core"
const QuickJS = await newQuickJSWASMModuleFromVariant(variant)
```

This variant was built with the following settings:

## Contents

- [Library: quickjs](README.md#library-quickjs)
- [Release mode: release](README.md#release-mode-release)
- [Exports: require import browser workerd](README.md#exports-require-import-browser-workerd)
- [Extra async magic? No](README.md#extra-async-magic-no)
- [Single-file, or separate .wasm file? wasm](README.md#single-file-or-separate-wasm-file-wasm)
- [More details](README.md#more-details)

## Library: quickjs

The original [bellard/quickjs](https://github.com/bellard/quickjs) library.

## Release mode: release

Optimized for performance; use when building/deploying your application.

## Exports: require import browser workerd

Exports the following in package.json for the package entrypoint:

- Exports a NodeJS-compatible CommonJS module, which is faster to load and run compared to an ESModule.
- Exports a NodeJS-compatible ESModule. Cannot be imported synchronously from a NodeJS CommonJS module.
- Exports a browser-compatible ESModule, designed to work in browsers and browser-like environments.
- Targets Cloudflare Workers.

## Extra async magic? No

The default, normal build. Note that both variants support regular async functions.

## Single-file, or separate .wasm file? wasm

Has a separate .wasm file. May offer better caching in your browser, and reduces the size of your JS bundle. If you have issues, try a 'singlefile' variant.
