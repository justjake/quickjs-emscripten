# @jitl/quickjs-singlefile-mjs-release-sync

Variant with the WASM data embedded into a NodeJS ESModule.

This generated package is part of [quickjs-emscripten](https://github.com/justjake/quickjs-emscripten).
It contains a variant of the quickjs WASM library, and can be used with quickjs-emscripten-core.

```typescript
import variant from "@jitl/quickjs-singlefile-mjs-release-sync"
import { newQuickJSWASMModuleFromVariant } from "quickjs-emscripten-core"
const QuickJS = await newQuickJSWASMModuleFromVariant(variant)
```

This variant was built with the following settings:

## Library: quickjs

The original [bellard/quickjs](https://github.com/bellard/quickjs) library.

## Release mode: release

Optimized for performance; use when building/deploying your application.

## Exports: import

Exports the following in package.json for the package entrypoint:

- undefined

## Extra async magic? No

The default, normal build. Note that both variants support regular async functions.

## Single-file, or separate .wasm file? singlefile

The WASM runtime is included directly in the JS file. Use if you run into issues with missing .wasm files when building or deploying your app.
