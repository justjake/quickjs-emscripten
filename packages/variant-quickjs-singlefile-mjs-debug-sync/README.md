# @jitl/quickjs-singlefile-mjs-debug-sync

Variant with the WASM data embedded into a NodeJS ESModule.

This generated package is part of [quickjs-emscripten](https://github.com/justjake/quickjs-emscripten).
It contains a variant of the quickjs WASM library, and can be used with quickjs-emscripten-core.

```typescript
import variant from "@jitl/quickjs-singlefile-mjs-debug-sync"
import { newQuickJSWASMModuleFromVariant } from "quickjs-emscripten-core"
const QuickJS = await newQuickJSWASMModuleFromVariant(variant)
```

This variant was built with the following settings:

## Library: quickjs

The original [bellard/quickjs](https://github.com/bellard/quickjs) library.

Version [2024-01-13+626e0d4e](https://github.com/bellard/quickjs/commit/626e0d4e60db2b81a0505fa9c61941e608624e7e) vendored to quickjs-emscripten on 2024-02-11.

## Release mode: debug

Enables assertions and memory sanitizers. Try to run your tests against debug variants, in addition to your preferred production variant, to catch more bugs.

## Exports: import

Exports the following in package.json for the package entrypoint:

- Exports a NodeJS-compatible ESModule. Cannot be imported synchronously from a NodeJS CommonJS module.

## Extra async magic? No

The default, normal build. Note that both variants support regular async functions.

## Single-file, or separate .wasm file? singlefile

The WASM runtime is included directly in the JS file. Use if you run into issues with missing .wasm files when building or deploying your app.
