# @jitl/quickjs-ng-wasmfile-release-sync

Variant with separate .WASM file. Supports browser ESM, NodeJS ESM, and NodeJS CommonJS.

This generated package is part of [quickjs-emscripten](https://github.com/justjake/quickjs-emscripten).
It contains a variant of the quickjs WASM library, and can be used with quickjs-emscripten-core.

```typescript
import variant from "@jitl/quickjs-ng-wasmfile-release-sync"
import { newQuickJSWASMModuleFromVariant } from "quickjs-emscripten-core"
const QuickJS = await newQuickJSWASMModuleFromVariant(variant)
```

This variant was built with the following settings:

## Library: quickjs-ng

[quickjs-ng](https://github.com/quickjs-ng/quickjs) is a fork of quickjs that tends to add features more quickly.

Version [git+7ded62c5](https://github.com/quickjs-ng/quickjs/commit/7ded62c536fca860b8106c39fb75f2df8fe27180) vendored to quickjs-emscripten on 2024-02-12.

## Release mode: release

Optimized for performance; use when building/deploying your application.

## Exports: require import browser workerd

Exports the following in package.json for the package entrypoint:

- Exports a NodeJS-compatible CommonJS module, which is faster to load and run compared to an ESModule.
- Exports a NodeJS-compatible ESModule. Cannot be imported synchronously from a NodeJS CommonJS module.
- Exports a browser-compatible ESModule, designed to work in browsers and browser-like environments.
- Targets Cloudflare Workers.

## Extra async magic? No

The default, normal build. Note that both variants support regular async functions.

## Single-file, or separate .wasm file? wasm

Has a separate .wasm file. May offer better caching in your browser, and reduces the size of your JS bundle. If you have issues, try a 'singlefile' variant.
